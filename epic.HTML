<p> Act 1: The new school  </p>

<p> I wake up every morning i shower and eat, my pops and moms give me my food to eat at new school. My mom says don't do it again Edmin , Okay mom. As i go to school i have to pass a road its always green light for the cars so means sometimes I'm a little late to school, but mostly because i cant find the rooms. My teacher peter introduces me to the class, one kid tried to trip me but i saved myself. As I sat down a boy wanted to be my friend, hi want to be friends my name is tommy. I never really had a friend before so i said yes to tommy, in lunch he would always defend be from every bully mostly because he is one of the kids that's skinny but really strong. When we went to lunch tommy had to go to the toilet, as soon as he left the bully's, Jared, Blake and Jake came up to my table jake picked me up because i was such a scrawny kid at that time and Jared and Blake stole my food. When tommy went back he said were you really that hungry? i didn't want to snitch on the bullies because they could beat me up easily so i said yep i was really hungry but i saw tommy looking at a girl named Sophie, Uh hello tommy earth to tommy, yeah what. Tommy I'm having trouble with this question, here you go said tommy , Thanks tommy! </p>

<p> Act 2: the temporary split </p>

<p> He saw Jared with his crush and it crushed him knowing that there's a school dance due to posters everywhere. I wasn't going to go to that dance because i have no one to take, probably go if tommy has someone to take and he wanted to go.
The next day i do my morning routine as i get in the classroom, I see tommy mad i wasn't sure what made him mad i asked him but he didn't tell, He was told that I was using him to get out of bully's path, get answers on homework and was the one who robbed him so he didn't want to be friends with me. I kept telling him i didn't use him and tried to rob him but he didn't believe me, Please tommy! I- The trio bully's came up to me and picked me up and punched me in my head until a teacher went by and checked i never snitched on them. When i was on the floor tommy came to me and helped me up he realized that the Trio bully's was lying about the using and the robbing. He said get up it might be here and we ran to our homes. My mom and dad wanted to know where i was so i said a lie and went on with my day </p>

<p> The happened i went to school i didn't see tommy he was absent in recess i had fun on the swing until one of the bully's came up to me and wanted to fight me at lunch, I was horrified he would beat me up because tommy wasn't here anymore. They kept insulting me my family made racist jokes which weren't even good and everyone was watching he said somethings that took it real far. In lunch he went up to me and i dodged it barley he threw another punch and it hit me where it hurts a ton of times and that's when i snapped i never wanted anymore of this anymore i sent a punch to his face another punch and I hit his stomach. I kept punching his stupid face and then i got snitched on by tommy's crush Sophie.
